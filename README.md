=================

My first stab at a PebbleKit JS app

Special thanks to Wunderpy who reverse engineered Wunderlist's API:

TODO List:
-----------
1. Build lists with tasks as a submenu
2. Build a task page
3. Dynamically grow and shrink the number of tasks in c
4. Pass data spanning more than one message
